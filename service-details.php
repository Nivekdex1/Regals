            <h1>Service Details</h1>
            <p>Our services are designed around clients' objectives. Below are the typical modules we provide â€” each engagement is tailored to the client's priorities and complexity.</p>

            <h3>1. Early Case Assessment</h3>
            <p>A focused review to identify the issues, likely costs and a recommended route (negotiation, mediation or court). We provide an initial plan and clear next steps.</p>

            <h3>2. Financial Disclosure & Valuation</h3>
            <p>We manage disclosure requests, instruct accountants for valuations, and build practical settlement proposals that consider tax, pensions and business interests.</p>

            <h3>3. Negotiation & Settlement</h3>
            <p>Negotiation on your behalf, using formal proposals and settlement agreements. Wherever possible we seek to reach a binding agreement without prolonged litigation.</p>

            <h3>4. Court Representation</h3>
            <p>If court becomes necessary, we prepare robust applications and represent clients at hearings. Our approach combines thorough preparation with tactical advocacy.</p>

            <h3>5. Post-Settlement Support</h3>
            <p>Assistance with implementing orders, transfers, pension sharing and any applications to vary or enforce orders if circumstances change.</p>
