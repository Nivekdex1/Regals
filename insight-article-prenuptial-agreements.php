    <h1>Prenuptial Agreements: A Practical Guide</h1>
    <p>Prenuptial agreements can be a useful tool to set out expectations about finances before a marriage. While courts retain discretion, properly prepared agreements strengthen the chance they will be given weight.</p>

    <h3>What courts consider</h3>
    <p>Court considerations include whether the agreement was entered into freely, the level of financial disclosure and whether the agreement is fair in light of the parties' circumstances.</p>

    <h3>Timing and disclosure</h3>
    <p>Early advice is essential. Full and frank disclosure of assets and liabilities, independent legal advice for both parties, and sufficient time to consider the document all help its enforceability.</p>

    <h3>Practical steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Seek early legal advice for both parties.</li>
        <li>Prepare full financial schedules and disclosures.</li>
        <li>Negotiate reasonable terms and use independent counsel.</li>
    </ol>
