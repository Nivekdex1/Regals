    <h1>Child Maintenance: What You Need To Know</h1>
    <p>This short guide explains how child maintenance is calculated, what counts as income, and the differences between private arrangements and the Child Maintenance Service (CMS).</p>

    <h3>How maintenance is calculated</h3>
    <p>The CMS uses a formula based on the paying parent's gross income, the number of children and whether the paying parent has other children or shared care. Private arrangements are also common and can be tailored to your family's needs.</p>

    <h3>Private agreements vs CMS</h3>
    <p>Private agreements offer flexibility but rely on both parties' cooperation. The CMS provides an enforceable framework but may not reflect individual expenses or family arrangements. We help clients weigh these options and draft agreements where appropriate.</p>

    <h3>Variations and enforcement</h3>
    <p>If circumstances change (income, care arrangements) a variation application may be appropriate. The CMS also offers enforcement options if payments stop.</p>
